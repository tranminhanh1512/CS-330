## Introduction and Overview of C++
### 1. What is C++? 
C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. It is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applicationn and gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. 
### 2. History
C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. It has expanded significantly overtime and was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20. C++ is usually implemented as a complier language and used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++ has proven to be highly versatile, finding utility in diverse domains. Its notable strengths lie in software infrastructure and applications with limited resources. These include desktop software, video game development, server-side applications such as e-commerce, web search engines, and databases, as well as performance-critical systems like telephone switching systems and space probes.
### 3. Why we should learn C++?
C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language. It provides a solid foundation in programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, and object-oriented programming. C++ supports cross-platform development and allows for fine-grained control over system resources and memory,
